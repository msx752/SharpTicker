# Storage

The store holds tickers, cron occurrences, run history and locks. Without configuration SharpTicker uses an **in-memory** store, which is lost when the process stops and cannot be shared between instances.

| Store | Package | Shared between instances |
|---|---|---|
| In-memory (default) | `SharpTicker` | No |
| Entity Framework Core | `SharpTicker.EntityFrameworkCore` | Yes |
| MongoDB | `SharpTicker.MongoDB` | Yes |
| Redis | `SharpTicker.Caching.StackExchangeRedis` | Yes |

## Entity Framework Core

Works with any relational EF Core provider, such as SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite or MySQL. There are two ways to use it.

### A separate DbContext

SharpTicker brings its own `SharpTickerDbContext`:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using SharpTicker.DependencyInjection;
using SharpTicker.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContextFactory;
using SharpTicker.EntityFrameworkCore.DependencyInjection;

builder.Services.AddSharpTicker(options =>
{
    options.AddOperationalStore(ef =>
    {
        ef.UseSharpTickerDbContext<SharpTickerDbContext>(db =>
            db.UseNpgsql(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("Scheduler")));
    });
});
```

### Your own DbContext

To keep the tables in your application's database and migrations, map them into your own context:

```csharp
using SharpTicker.EntityFrameworkCore.Customizer;

options.AddOperationalStore(ef =>
{
    ef.UseApplicationDbContext<AppDbContext>(ConfigurationType.UseModelCustomizer);
});
```

With `ConfigurationType.UseModelCustomizer` the tables are added to your model automatically. With `IgnoreModelCustomizer`, apply (from `SharpTicker.EntityFrameworkCore.Configurations`) `TimeTickerConfigurations<TimeTickerEntity>`, `CronTickerConfigurations<CronTickerEntity>` and `CronTickerOccurrenceConfigurations<CronTickerEntity>` yourself in `OnModelCreating`.

### Schema and tables

Tables are created in the `ticker` schema: `TimeTickers`, `CronTickers` and `CronTickerOccurrences`. Change the schema with `ef.SetSchema("...")`. Create the tables with EF Core migrations, or with `EnsureCreated()` / `GenerateCreateScript()` when you do not use migrations.

Other options: `SetDbContextPoolSize(int)` (default 1024).

## MongoDB

```csharp
using SharpTicker.MongoDB.DependencyInjection;

options.AddOperationalStore(mongo =>
{
    mongo.UseSharpTickerMongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017", "scheduler");
});
```

- `UseExistingMongoClient(databaseName)` reuses an `IMongoClient` that is already registered in dependency injection.
- One of the two is required; startup fails otherwise.
- Collections use the prefix `ticker_` (`ticker_TimeTickers`, `ticker_CronTickers`, `ticker_CronTickerOccurrences`). Change it with `SetCollectionPrefix("...")`.
- Indexes are created at startup.

## Redis

```csharp
using SharpTicker.Caching.StackExchangeRedis.DependencyInjection;

options.AddStackExchangeRedis(redis =>
{
    redis.Configuration = "localhost:6379";
});
```

- Set one of `Configuration`, `ConfigurationOptions`, `ConnectionMultiplexer` or `ConnectionMultiplexerFactory`; startup fails otherwise.
- `InstanceName` (default `sharpticker:`) is the prefix under which nodes report that they are alive. Job data uses its own `tq:*` keys.
- Each node sends a heartbeat every `NodeHeartbeatInterval` (default one minute). Jobs held by a node that stopped sending heartbeats are released for others.
- For trimmed or AOT applications, set `JsonSerializerContext`.

## Choosing a store

- **In-memory** for development, tests and single-process tools where losing jobs on restart is acceptable.
- **EF Core** when you already run a relational database. With your own `DbContext` the tables live next to your data and in your migrations.
- **MongoDB** when your application already uses MongoDB.
- **Redis** for a fast, shared store when you already run Redis and accept its persistence model.
